\chapter{Acceptance Level}

\section{Acceptance mode}

The project adopts a method of submitting results and acceptance in stages. After confirming the results of this phase, we will start the implementation of the next phase. In order to ensure that the project is always carried out under the premise of the implementation of the two sides'consensus.

The acceptance of the project phase will be based on the implementation goals, work plans and submitted phase completion reports confirmed by both parties.

The Flying car's Project Manager(or its licensor) will sign the confirmation report in writing or provide an optimized opinion to the recipient project team within 7 working days from the date of the client's application for acceptance.
