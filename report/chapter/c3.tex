\chapter{Project Organizational Structure}

\section{Project organizational chart}

The Flying Vehicle Design and Production project team consists of a project steering committee, a customer service team, a project manager, a functional team, and a technical team. The project was initiated by the Project Steering Committee, which is also the main decision maker and strategy maker for the project. All project matters are coordinated and managed by the project team. The project team will consist of full-time project managers, technicians, and business owners and experts in key functional areas.In addition, the project team will include technical and functional consultants from the client side.

\section{Responsibility}

The work of this project is completed by a project team composed of Ethane Autoplane Co.Ltd. and the client side, which means that the two parties form a common working group in the project to complete each project task. The main consideration of this arrangement is to ensure that the design and manufacturing of the flight and the car meet the customer's requirements during the project, and when necessary, communicate with the customer about the design details of the flying car, and coordinate the design between the designer and the customer. Only in this way can the order of the design and manufacturing of the flying car be guaranteed.

Specifically, the division of labor and responsibilities of Ethane Autoplane Co.Ltd and the client are:

\subsection{Project promotion team and coordination group}

The ultimate owner of a flying car product is not the project team, nor the manufacturing staff, but the entire staff of the project, including the leaders of all departments and all employees. So throughout the project, the involvement, input, and support of these people play a key role in the success of the entire project. It is therefore necessary to clarify the responsibilities of these people for the project.
